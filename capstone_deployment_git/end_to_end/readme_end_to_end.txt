In order to use this python program, please go to the 
end_to_end directory and run "python3 end_to_end.py" 
in command line.

Then please enter an integer following the instructions.

=========================================================================

unit_test_1.py is supposed to test the case where the user is a new user.
This means user = tot_user_num.

In order to run unit_test_1.py please type "python3 unit_test_1.py"
in the command line. 

We will be prompted to inter an integer again because end_to_end.py
is executed again when we import end_to_end.py in unit_test_1.py.

No matter what integer we enter, the user that is used for unit_test_1.py
is always set to be "tot_user_num".
